## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Payment Page Created**
- Created comprehensive payment page: `/apps/web/app/payment/[id]/page.tsx`
- Features:
  - Transaction details display
  - Payment instructions
  - File upload for payment proof
  - Status tracking with icons
  - Bank transfer information
  - Responsive design

### 2. **Booking Flow Fixed**  
- Updated `apps/web/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`
- Updated `apps/web/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- **Key Fix**: Changed `onSuccess` callback to redirect to payment page instead of just closing modal
- **Before**: `onClose()` → User returned to main page  
- **After**: `router.push(\`/payment/\${transactionId}\`)` → User directed to payment

### 3. **API Integration Enhanced**
- Added missing routes to `transactionRoutesNew.ts`:
  - Payment proof upload: `POST /:transactionId/payment-proof`
  - Transaction cancellation: `PATCH /:transactionId/cancel` 
  - Payment confirmation: `PATCH /:transactionId/confirm`
- Fixed API proxy configuration in `next.config.ts`

### 4. **Payment System Complete**
- Transaction status workflow: `WAITING_PAYMENT` → `WAITING_CONFIRMATION` → `CONFIRMED`
- File upload validation (images & PDF)
- Payment expiration handling
- Bank transfer instructions
